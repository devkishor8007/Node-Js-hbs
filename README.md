# Node-Js-hbs
Here, I am using template engine hbs and create a node js website.

For this project, you can have this package which are
npm i express - this is a web framework of node.js ie express.js
npm i nodemon - it helps automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected.
npm i hbs - it is the express.js template engine and through this, we can make static and dynamic website.

Check out the official website of NodeJs.
